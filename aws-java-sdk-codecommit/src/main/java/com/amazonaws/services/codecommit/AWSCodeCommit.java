/**
 * Interface for accessing CodeCommit.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AbstractAWSCodeCommit} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS CodeCommit</fullname>
 * <p>
 * This is the <i>AWS CodeCommit API Reference</i>. This reference provides descriptions of the operations and data
 * types for AWS CodeCommit API along with usage examples.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Repositories, by calling the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>BatchGetRepositories</a>, which returns information about one or more repositories associated with your AWS
 * account
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>CreateRepository</a>, which creates an AWS CodeCommit repository
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>DeleteRepository</a>, which deletes an AWS CodeCommit repository
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetRepository</a>, which returns information about a specified repository
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>ListRepositories</a>, which lists all AWS CodeCommit repositories associated with your AWS account
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>UpdateRepositoryDescription</a>, which sets or updates the description of the repository
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>UpdateRepositoryName</a>, which changes the name of the repository. If you change the name of a repository, no
 * other users of that repository will be able to access it until you send them the new HTTPS or SSH URL to use.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Branches, by calling the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>CreateBranch</a>, which creates a new branch in a specified repository
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetBranch</a>, which returns information about a specified branch
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>ListBranches</a>, which lists all branches for a specified repository
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>UpdateDefaultBranch</a>, which changes the default branch for a repository
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Information about committed code in a repository, by calling the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetBlob</a>, which returns the base-64 encoded content of an individual Git blob object within a repository
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetCommit</a>, which returns information about a commit, including commit messages and author and committer
 * information
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetDifferences</a>, which returns information about the differences in a valid commit specifier (such as a branch,
 * tag, HEAD, commit ID or other fully qualified reference)
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Triggers, by calling the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>GetRepositoryTriggers</a>, which returns information about triggers configured for a repository
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>PutRepositoryTriggers</a>, which replaces all triggers for a repository and can be used to create or delete
 * triggers
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>TestRepositoryTriggers</a>, which tests the functionality of a repository trigger by sending data to the trigger
 * target
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
